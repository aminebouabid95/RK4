This script solves ordinary differential equations using the the 4th order Runge-Kutta method (RK4)
It takes as input a mathematical expression f expressed in terms of x and y, and 4 variables defined as follows:

x0 and y0: Initial conditions
h: Step size
xf: Final x value 

Numerical Values of y are stored in the list Y and printed automatically
Finally the script plots Y =f(X) using the numerically calculated values
